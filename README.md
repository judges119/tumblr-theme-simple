Simple Tumblr Theme
===================

A simple Tumblr theme that uses Bootstrap. Excess information hidden under info logos. Provides a search function, utilises tagged pages options as well.

To install, simply go to your Tumblr page (such as http://judges119.tumblr.com), click Customise in the top-right corner (you'll need to be logged in to do this). On the sidebar to the left should be an option to "Edit HTML" (it might be kinda hidden/not-really-focal), hit this and you'll have a new sidebar in which you can edit your theme. From here, paste the contents of theme.html into this code-editing window (deleting whatever was previously there first), then Update Preview and Save.
